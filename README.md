# Elementor File Dropzone

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Enhances Elementor file inputs with a modern dropzone style. ü™Ñ Created by [Rakesh Mandal](https://github.com/therakeshm).

## Description

This plugin enhances Elementor's file input fields by transforming them into a modern, user-friendly dropzone with drag-and-drop functionality.

## TO-DOs

- [ ] Maybe add files count into the dropzone itself when the file is selected, instead of showing a full list?
- [ ] Ability for the end users to configure the basic styles
- [ ] Configure the "drag and drop.." label
- [ ] Inject styles on elementor edit mode, so it wont look like broken

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Enjoy the enhanced file input fields in your Elementor forms.
